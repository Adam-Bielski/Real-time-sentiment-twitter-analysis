# Real-time-sentiment-twitter-analysis

#### Aim

Twitter data can provide us with real-time opinions on a given topics/brand/company and in most cases with low costs.
This is a perfect way to assess the image of a company, when you run it or want to invest in it.

Based on the sentiment analysis of tweets we can check how many of them use: negative, neutral or positive words, across time
This time we track "Biden" word to know what the world thinks of him!

#### Execution of an app

Thanks to the Twitter Developer account you can stream real-time tweets. They are continuously saved on the PostgreSQL databases on the Heroku, which apart from storing the data in cloud enables you to run an application written in Python (Dash & Plotly).
